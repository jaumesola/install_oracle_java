Bash script for fast installing ORACLE Java JDK on "deb like" systems
--------------------------

### Use

sudo su

./install_java.sh PATH_TO_JDK_TAR_FILE [INSTALL_PATH]

The default installation path is ```/usr/local/java```.

This script is still not definite and works at the moment. If Oracle
significantly changes something I will probably fix the script. :)
